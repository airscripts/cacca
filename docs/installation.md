# Installation

## Overview
If you made this far, means that you love Cacca and I deeply appreciate that.
Without making more lovely sentences, let's start up our process for installing this browny framework.

## Requirements
In order to use Cacca, you will need the following:
- Python >= 3.11;
- A package manager for Python.

## Install
Now that we have all the requirements at our hand, let's just install Cacca with this command:
```bash
$ pip install cacca
```
...and that's all. Yes it was *that* simple.
